I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of California, Irvine, specializing in **Econometrics** and **Quantitative Methods**. My research focuses on developing novel econometric techniques, particularly in the areas of **Limited Dependent variables**, **Quantile regression**,  **Macroeconometris** and **Panel data analysis**. 

I am on the 2025-2026 Job Market. My job market paper presents a general approach to modeling and estimation of time series models with discrete outcomes where errors are autoregressive and lagged dependence may be in observed discrete outcomes or latent dependent variable.(see [Research](/research/) for the paper).

<!-- ## Research Interests -->

<!-- My primary research interests include:


- **Computational Methods**: MCMC estimation techniques and efficient algorithms for complex econometric models.
- **Quantile Regression**: Developing flexible Bayesian approaches to quantile regression, including applications to ordinal models and panel data.
- **Applied Econometrics**: Applications in housing markets and public policy analysis. -->

<!-- ## Current Research

I am currently working on several research projects that push the boundaries of econometric methodology:

- **Flexible Bayesian Quantile Analysis**: Developing more flexible frameworks for Bayesian quantile regression that separate skewness from quantile parameters
- **Panel Quantile Regression**: Advancing methods for quantile regression in panel data settings with mean differencing approaches
- **Discrete Parameter Models**: Working on econometric models with applications to policy analysis and decision-making

## Teaching Experience

I have extensive teaching experience as a Teaching Assistant at UC Irvine, having taught across multiple levels:

**Guest Lectures:**
- "Discrete Choice Models" (Econometrics II)
- "Quantile Regressions" (Statistics and Econometrics III)  
- "Flexible Bayesian Quantile Regression" (Discrete Choice Econometrics)

**Graduate Courses:**
- Statistics & Econometrics III (ECON 220C)

**Undergraduate Courses:**
- Applied Econometrics I & II (ECON 122A, 122B)
- Intermediate Economics I & II (ECON 100A, 100B)
- Basic Economics I (ECON 20A)
- Econometrics II (ECON 123B)
- And many others across various terms

## Academic Background

I am pursuing my doctoral degree in Economics at UC Irvine, where I have developed expertise in both theoretical and applied econometrics. My work combines rigorous mathematical foundations with practical applications to real-world economic problems. -->
