title: "Flexible Bayesian Quantile Analysis of Residential Rental Rates"
collection: publications
category: working_papers
abstract: "This article develops a random effects quantile regression model for panel data that allows for increased distributional flexibility, multivariate heterogeneity, and time-invariant covariates in situations where mean regression may be unsuitable. Our approach is Bayesian and builds upon the generalized asymmetric Laplace distribution to decouple the modeling of skewness from the quantile parameter. We derive two efficient simulation-based estimation algorithms, demonstrate their properties and performance in targeted simulation studies, and employ them in the computation of marginal likelihoods to enable formal Bayesian model comparisons. The methodology is applied in a study of U.S. residential rental rates following the Global Financial Crisis. Our empirical results provide interesting insights on the interaction between rents and economic, demographic and policy variables, weigh in on key modeling features, and overwhelmingly support the additional flexibility at all quantiles and across several sub-samples. The practical differences that arise as a result of allowing for flexible modeling can be nontrivial, especially for quantiles away from the median."
