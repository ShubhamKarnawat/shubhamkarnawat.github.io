# excerpt: 'This article is motivated by the lack of flexibility in Bayesian quantile regression for ordinal models where the error follows an asymmetric Laplace (AL) distribution. The inflexibility arises because the skewness of the distribution is completely specified when a quantile is chosen. To overcome this shortcoming, we derive the cumulative distribution function (and the moment-generating function) of the generalized asymmetric Laplace (GAL) distribution – a generalization of AL distribution that separates the skewness from the quantile parameter – and construct a working likelihood for the ordinal quantile model. The resulting framework is termed flexible Bayesian quantile regression for ordinal (FBQROR) models. However, its estimation is not straightforward. We address estimation issues and propose an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure based on Gibbs sampling and joint Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated in multiple simulation studies and implemented to analyze public opinion on homeownership as the best long-term investment in the United States following the Great Recession.'

abstract: 'The paper presents a general approach to modeling and estimation of time series models with discrete outcomes where errors are autoregressive and lagged dependence may be in observed discrete outcomes or latent dependent variable. With such a general framework, estimation is challenging due to large dimension of the latent variable and high correlation in MCMC draws. To deal with these estimation issues, the paper presents efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that with a novel blocking technique in sampling the latent variable. The importance of modeling autoregressive errors is demonstrated by comparing the models with its modeling counterparts having independent errors. The performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in multiple simulation studies and the benefits of the proposed models are illustrated in a study of the US business cycles.'
