# excerpt: 'This article is motivated by the lack of flexibility in Bayesian quantile regression for ordinal models where the error follows an asymmetric Laplace (AL) distribution. The inflexibility arises because the skewness of the distribution is completely specified when a quantile is chosen. To overcome this shortcoming, we derive the cumulative distribution function (and the moment-generating function) of the generalized asymmetric Laplace (GAL) distribution – a generalization of AL distribution that separates the skewness from the quantile parameter – and construct a working likelihood for the ordinal quantile model. The resulting framework is termed flexible Bayesian quantile regression for ordinal (FBQROR) models. However, its estimation is not straightforward. We address estimation issues and propose an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure based on Gibbs sampling and joint Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated in multiple simulation studies and implemented to analyze public opinion on homeownership as the best long-term investment in the United States following the Great Recession.'

abstract: 'The paper presents a general approach to modeling and estimating time series models with discrete outcomes, where the errors are autoregressive and lagged dependence may be present in either the observed discrete outcomes or a latent dependent variable. Within such a general framework, estimation is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the latent variable and strong correlation in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) draws. To address these estimation issues, the paper introduces efficient MCMC algorithms that employ a novel blocking technique for sampling the latent variable. The importance of modeling autoregressive errors is demonstrated by comparing these models with counterparts that assume independent errors. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated through multiple simulation studies, and the advantages of the proposed models are illustrated in an application to US business cycles.'
